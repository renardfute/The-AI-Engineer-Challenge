### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

## Theme and Color Requirements
- Use a modern dark theme with blue accents
- Primary colors: Dark blue (#1a1a2e), Electric blue (#16213e), Bright accent (#0f3460)
- Use gradient backgrounds and rounded corners
- Smooth animations throughout

## Text Color and Accessibility  
- ALL text must be light colored (white, light gray) on dark backgrounds
- User messages: white text (#ffffff)
- AI messages: light gray text (#f3f4f6)
- Interface text: light gray (#e5e7eb)
- Ensure high contrast for accessibility - NEVER use dark text on dark backgrounds
- Accent text: Bright blue (#60a5fa) for links/highlights
- Error text: Light red (#fca5a5)
